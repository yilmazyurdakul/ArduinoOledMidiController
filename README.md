MI am a musician so I use recording software, vst instruments, playback devices and more. It is easy to use physical knobs or faders but if you are in front of the computer, you have to follow the screen.

It is impossible if you are a drummer :)

I built simple OLED encoder menu system before. In this project I improved that so much and combined with MIDI system.

Specifications
1 joystick to control XY plotter
4 faders (can be increased due to board)
9 buttons
OLED display
Encoder controller
Enable / disable
Settings menu
Enable / disable
Easy to use (for me)
MIDI messages flows over the USB cable to computer. Hairless MIDI receiver takes the serial port signals and sends to MIDI channels.
